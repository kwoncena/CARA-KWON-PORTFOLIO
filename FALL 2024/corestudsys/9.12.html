    <p>I recently downloaded my Spotify data, which came in two parts. The first option, my general
        account data, was delivered quickly and contained account information, payments, streaming
        history, my library, user data, and more. The second option was the extended streaming history,
        which included the time and date I listened to each song, what album it was from, and even
        where I was when I played it. This file held everything I had listened to on Spotify from 2014 to
        the beginning of September 2024.
        Interestingly, Spotify doesn’t just track what I listen to–it also logs the date, time and even the ip
        address of where i was when i played each song, kind of cool kind of stalker mode. This level of
        detail made me think about the potential uses of all this data, but i’m still not sure what to do
        with it all.
        Seeing all this data felt nostalgic, as it tracked my personal growth—back in 2914, I was just 11
        years old, and now, I’m 20.... I still listen to many of the same songs from back then. In fact, I
        often find myself returning to those tracks, so as I listen to these songs now, I can still remember
        what I would’ve been doing back then or where i could’ve been.
        Originally, I wanted to download my Netflix data too, but since its under my family’s account, my
        father was reluctant to share it. I thought it would have been fun and nostalgic to have the data
        of what I have seen and heard over the years.</p>
